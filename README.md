# Plotting_Poetry2020
This repository includes complementary materials of our paper for Plotting Poetry Proceedings: Hernández-Lorenzo, L.; De Sisto, M., Pérez, Á.; De la Rosa, J.; Ros, S.; González-Blanco, E.: "Quantitative metrical automatic analysis ofSpanish Poetry with Rantanplan: a first approach".

## Corpus
The corpus used in this study includes four Early Modern Spanish poets, namely Garcilaso de la Vega (1503-1536), Fernando de Herrera (1534-1597), Luis de Góngora (1561-1627) and Lope de Vega (1562-1635). The poems of each author are available in this repository, with the exception of Fernando de Herrera, whose texts were extracted from Laura Hernández's unpubished dissertion (Hernández-Lorenzo 2020). 

The texts are offered in three versions:

- An untagged (plain text) version of the corpus is included in the "corpus" folder.

- The automatically annotated version with stress positions is included in the "" folder. This one does not include the text of the poems, but only stress positions detected by Rantanplan (De la Rosa et al., 2020). Stress positions are marked by the number corresponding to the syllable order
